## Before / After

### 1. Message management

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Org settings UI orphaned; wrote to dropped `organizations.quickMessageTemplates` | `/settings` → **Mensajes operativos** applies templates to all active properties via `Property.quickMessageTemplates` |

### 2. Guest name + sync

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| iCal could overwrite enriched real name if Airbnb summary changed | Real names preserved (`ical-guest-name-sync.ts`); placeholders still fill |
| iCal cron daily 06:15; email reconcile daily 06:35 | iCal every 30 min; email reconcile at :05/:35; enrichment retry :15/:45 |

### 3–6. Calendar

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Platform icon on checked-out bars | Hidden when `visualState === "checked_out"` |
| Sidebar showed truncated internal property id | Removed `formatPropertyRef`; unit number only |
| Detail panel showed cuid/icalUid for all platforms | Airbnb confirmation code only when available |

### 4–5. Prospecting

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Manual copy-paste to WhatsApp | Primary **WhatsApp** button opens `wa.me` with message; auto CONTACTED |
| Raw URL columns in table | Icon action row (WhatsApp, web, Instagram) |
| No stage templates | Editable textarea per pipeline stage |

### 7. TTLock

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Battery/online only on property detail | Shown on each `/smart-access` reservation row |

### 8. Guest registration

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Silent skip when no notification emails | Records `guestRegistrationAdminNotificationError` for operator visibility |

### 9. Pricing

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Dry-run set `listingId = property.id` (cuid) as SYNCED | `PENDING` with empty listingId; excluded from price fetch |
